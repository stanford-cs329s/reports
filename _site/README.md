# CS 329S (Winter 2021) Final Project Reports

We recommend that you write your report in Google Docs then migrate it Markdown. I find the migration fairly straightforward, and you can also use the [Docs to Markdown add-on](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607) to automatically convert Docs to Markdown.

Once you've had your post in Markdown, create a pull request to add your post to the course's website.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone it to your local machine.
3. Add your report under the folder `_posts`. You'll find a template there. Remember to add date to your report's filename too, so your filename will look something like this: `2021-03-18-report-title.markdown`.

  After you've finished your post, you can run `bundle exec jekyll build` or `jekyll build` to build your post. The built HTML folder should show up under `_site`.

  You can run `bundle exec jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve` to preview the post on `http://localhost:4000/reports/`.

4. Once satisfied with your post, make a pull request to this repo.


You might need to install Jekyll. If you're note familiar with Jekyll, you can find [Jekyll's installation instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

Let us know if you have any question!
