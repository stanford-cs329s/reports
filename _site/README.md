3. Add your report under the folder `_posts`. You'll find a template there. Remember to add date to your report's filename too, so your filename will look something like this: `2021-03-18-report-title.markdown`.

  After you've finished your post, you can run `bundle exec jekyll build` or `jekyll build` to build your post. The built HTML folder should show up under `_site`.

  You can run `bundle exec jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve` to preview the post on `http://localhost:4000/reports/`.

4. Once satisfied with your post, make a pull request to this repo.


You might need to install Jekyll. If you're note familiar with Jekyll, you can find [Jekyll's installation instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
